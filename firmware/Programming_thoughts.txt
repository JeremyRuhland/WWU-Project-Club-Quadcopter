Thoughts and psudocode on the subject of software design, example functions and things we should remember about the hardware/software interface.

Basic program flow:
Setup I/O and timers
Loop forever (at whatever frequency decided):
 Read IMU data
 Read radio data
 Calculate motor speeds, send to ESCs


void set_pwm(uint_8 motor_number, uint_8 duty_cycle) {
 switch (motor_number) {
  case 0: //All motors
   TC0CRA = duty_cycle;
   TC0CRB = duty_cycle;
   TC2CRA = duty_cycle;
   TC2CRB = duty_cycle;
   break;
  case 1:
   TC0CRA = duty_cycle;
   break;
  case 2:
   TC0CRB = duty_cycle;
   break;
  case 3:
   TC2CRA = duty_cycle;
   break;
  case 4:
   TC2CRB = duty_cycle;
   break;
 }
}

Reading PPM values:
ICP pin connects to timer/counter1, the 16 bit timer for "input capture mode"
timer/counter0 and timer/counter2, both 8 bit timers will be used for PWM output control.

Example:
timer/counter0 pwm signal on output OC0A
TCCR0A |= 1<<COM0A1 | 1<<COM0A0 | 1<<COM0B1 | 1<<COM0B0 | 1<<WGM00;
TCCR0B |= 1<<WGM02 | 1<<CS01;
OCR0A = ;
