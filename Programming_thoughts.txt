Thoughts and psudocode on the subject of software design, example functions and things we should remember about the hardware/software interface.

set_pwm(motor number, duty cycle)

Reading PPM values:
ICP pin connects to timer/counter1, the 16 bit timer for "input capture mode"
timer/counter0 and timer/counter2, both 8 bit timers will be used for PWM output control.

Example:
timer/counter0 pwm signal on output OC0A
TCCR0A |= 1<<WGM00 | 1<<WGM01 | 1<<COM01 | 1<<COM00 | 1<<COM0A1 | 1<<COM0A0;
TCCR0B |=
